                <li><a href="#"><h3 id="FM">Family</h3></a></li>
                <p>
                    Your friends and family will always have a sort of relative-cousin-ish type relationship with each other. A lot of thems they well refer to your parents as their aunts and uncles. There is also a good chance that they will also treat your siblings as if they were also their siblings.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your family should always tell you to choose your friends carefully. But when you've had your friends for years, it's almost like you've got more siblings that you just don't see as often.
                </p>
			</ul>
		</nav>

		<nav id="FRRC" class="column">
            <ul>
				<li><a href="#"><h3 id="RV">Partner</h3></a></li>
                <p>
                    True friends will always have your back when it comes to finding you a partner. They will give you a lot of advice and tips to help you get that girl that you want so bad. They will also tell you when chasing after a girl is no longer worth it. Always consider the advice of people who care about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teasing is also commonplace and it may get annoying, but if it works it works. In my experience, I found out the girl liked me. I was hesitant because I was scared it wouldn't work. Friends gave me advice. I considered it. And now I've been in a relationship for about 8 months. Thanks guys.
